# 🚦 Prim's Algorithm Implementation - Transportation Networks 🛣️

This repository showcases an implementation of **Prim's Algorithm** to design the most **cost-efficient transportation network**. Whether it’s for **roads**, **railways**, or **pipelines**, Prim’s Algorithm ensures **minimal total construction cost** while maintaining full connectivity between nodes (cities/stations/points).

## 📌 What is Prim’s Algorithm?

Prim’s Algorithm is a **greedy algorithm** that helps find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a graph. It connects all the nodes in a network with the **lowest total edge weight**, ensuring there are no cycles.

Used in real-world problems such as:
- 🚉 Railway line planning
- 🛣️ Highway construction
- 🛢️ Pipeline design
- 🖧 Network cabling and optimization

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Language: `Java` (update as per your code)
- Data Structures: Graph (Adjacency Matrix/List), Priority Queue
- Visualization (optional): `matplotlib`, `networkx` (if used in Python)
